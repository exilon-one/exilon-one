### FAQs

&nbsp;&nbsp;**What is *exilon-one*?**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*exilon-one* is both my alias and a big repository for a reason which will be explained.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an alias, exilon-one is derived from exilon which is *epsilon* mixed with *lex* and
added *one* separated with a dash. It's like "XBOX One" or "Ubuntu One", the name is clever so I based my name from these
two.

As a big repository, it's where I put what I learn and will contain my personal journal. It's interrelated to my personal
site if I choose to make one.

&nbsp;&nbsp;**Why is your alias named *exilon-one*?**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It started when I researched about Greek characters that were used in mathematics, I was looking for
a character that is used in Computer Science and I found that epsilon (Îµ) means ["empty string"][1].

I always wanted to put "lex" (The shortest version of my name) somewhere in epsilon so I started thinking how, I found out
that _**exilon**_ fits, I thought of adding **-one** because it sounds clever.

&nbsp;&nbsp;**Why make a big repository for learning?**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I am practicing my writing skills (Grammar and use, not handwriting) and I won't lose my
data since GitHub will store my files. Feel free to read along, I won't mind.

This isn't just for learning, I plan to make a personal website using Github pages and code the website from scratch, it
will represent my achievements, failures and successes. This is like the repo that will store the future contents of the
website.

&nbsp;&nbsp;**What do you intend to learn?**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K-12 subjects as well as college level subjects. I am interested in Computer Science and will put
what I learn here. I live in Philippines and for anyone to relate if they wish to do so, history is an exception.
